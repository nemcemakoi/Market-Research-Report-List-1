<p><strong>The Papaya Seed Oil Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Chemical Extraction</li><li>Physical Squeeze</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The papaya seed oil market is primarily segmented into two extraction types: chemical extraction and physical squeeze. Chemical extraction employs solvents to efficiently separate oil from seeds, resulting in a higher yield but potentially affecting purity.
